## Roadmap

- ✅ chrome omnibox extension
- ✅ add support for `suggest()` execution (for rapid searching)
- ✅ async fetch support for external data (example: using Notion database)
- ✅ remove pug dependency (use ejs.co)
- ✅ view renderer abstraction and `includes/` to standardise header metadata
- ✅ `wut` (glossary command)
- ✅ `bk` (bookmark command): key-value store for "dummy" bookmarks
- ✅ persistant db layer (crud api exposed for each command (lowdb? level?)
- ✅ add `author` property in command
- ✅ ~~add meta commands?~~ opted for .operators! (`{cmd}[.{operator}] {input}`)
  - `bk` operators (`.new` `.list` `.update`)
  - `drv` operators (`.new` `.doc` `.sheet` `.slides` `.form` `.email` `.cal`)
  - `gs` migrate existing "options" to operators
  - `ntn` (notion) --> `ntn.wut` replaces `wut`? extend to `.prd` and `.rfc`?
- ✅ expose cookie() function to commands through rabbit2 api (read/set cookies)
- private/hidden ("unlisted") commands - those starting with an underscore - don't appear is the listing
- expose a convinience "suggest" [typeahead](https://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/examples/) form in every commands view renderer? For example: wut
- `go` support folders (via `/`?) and group filter in the list view
- ❌ ~~`go` allow name-spaced by user id, giving preference if request is from matched user or allowing anyone to target that namespace <-- graceful solution to support "collisions"~~
- remove `serverResponse`/`serverRequest` from global rabbit2 object
- ✅ `html` (renders html): equivalent to: `data:text/html,<b>Hello World</b>`
- ❌ ~~`fig` filter your recent files (operators: `.favs`, `.new`, `.jam`)~~ Figma API is limited (no "recent files" or "favourite files" endpoints)
- authorisation via Google?
- add a homepage (to replace the `list` default (render via markup2html?)
- documentation:
  - rabbit2 ethos (opinionated, no async api)
  - anatomy of a command and input
  - jsdoc (comment-parser, documentation, jsdoc-to-markdown, jsdoc-parse, jsdoc)
  - https://engineering.linecorp.com/en/blog/api-documentation-comments-parsing/
- installation instructions for firefox, safari.
- package this up in a Chrome Extension to run locally?
- credits/powered by/view source in list view
- `/m/:cmdId.(:operators?)/` route to manage commands (`mv` to rename command/view/storage/cookies, `resetdb` to clear the db contents)

### Dev
  - is `/` a better input delimeter? (`{cmd}[.{operator}]/{input}`)
    - facilitates auto-linking in certain scenarios
  - add tests
  - modernise it a bit with some more professional eyes
  - typescriptify the repo
  - set up on internal server
  - contribution workflow
  - notion documentation
  - dedicated notion app api key
